# Master the Arrays 
## Arrays:-
<!-- The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. Each array element has a corresponding index number.  -->

#### Topics to learn arrays-->

1. [Rotation_of_arrays]
Rotation of array means shifting the elements of an array in a circular manner i.e., in the case of right circular shift the last element becomes the first element, and all other element moves one point to the right.

2. [Rearranging_an_array] 
Rearrangement of array elements suggests the changing of an initial order of elements following some conditions or operations.

3. [Range_queries_in_array]
Often you need to perform operations on a range of elements. These functions are known as range queries.

4. [Multidimensional_array] 
These are arrays having more than one dimension. The most used one is the 2-dimensional array, commonly known as a matrix.

#### Applications on Array
1.  Applications on Array
2.  Arrays store data elements of the same type.
3.  Arrays are employed when the size of the data set is known.
4.  Used to solve matrix problems.
5.  In a computer, this is used as a lookup table.
6.  The array can also implement database records.
7.  Helps in the implementation of the sorting algorithm.
8.  Variables of the same type can be saved under a single name.
9.  Arrays can be utilised for CPU scheduling.
10. Used to implement different data structures like as stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, and so on.

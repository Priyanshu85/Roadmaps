# Dynamic Programming
### Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
### The idea of solving any problem using Dynamic Programming is to divide a problem into 'overlapping' subproblems and then reconstructing the solution using these subproblems.

## Difference between Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithm:
| Greedy Algorithm | Dynamic Programming |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Immediate best solution | Optimal best solution |
| Sometimes gives optimal solution | Always gives optimal solution |
| Subproblems are not depended | Subproblems are interdepended |
| Faster runtime | Slower runtime |
